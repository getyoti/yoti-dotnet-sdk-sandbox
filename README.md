[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/yoti/Dotnet%20SDK%20Sandbox/_apis/build/status/getyoti.yoti-dotnet-sdk-sandbox?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/yoti/Dotnet%20SDK%20Sandbox/_build/latest?definitionId=9&branchName=master)

Welcome to the Yoti .NET Sandbox. This repo contains the tools you need to test your .NET back-end integration, alongside installation of the [Yoti .NET SDK](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-dotnet-sdk).

## Sandbox Supported Frameworks
- .NET Standard 2.1
- .NET Core App 3.1
- .NET 4.8

Please email [sdksupport@yoti.com](mailto:sdksupport@yoti.com) if you require a Target Framework which is not listed here.

## Installing the Sandbox

To install the Yoti Sandbox NuGet package you will need to install NuGet. You can find instructions to do that [here](http://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/guides/install-nuget)

To import the latest Yoti SDK into your project, enter the following command from NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio:

```
Install-Package Yoti.Sandbox
```

For other installation methods, see [nuget.org/packages/Yoti.Sandbox](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Yoti.Sandbox)

## Configuration

To initialise the `SandboxClient`, using either the Profile or DocScan `SandboxClientBuilder` (see examples in section below), you will need the following:

* `ClientSdkId` is the SDK identifier generated by Yoti Hub in the Key tab when you create your app. 
* `KeyPair` is the keyPair object of your private key (.pem file). It can be downloaded only once from the Keys tab in your Yoti Hub.

Please do not open the pem file as this might corrupt the key and you will need to create a new application.

## Code Examples

In the examples folder there are snippets for:
- [Yoti App](/Examples/Yoti.Auth.Sandbox.Examples/ProfileSandboxExample.cs)
- [Doc Scan](/Examples/Yoti.Auth.Sandbox.Examples/DocScanSandboxExample.cs)
